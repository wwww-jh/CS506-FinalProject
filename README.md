# ðŸ“Š Restaurant Foot Traffic Prediction and Analysis System

A full-stack data science web application built for CS506 at Boston University. This system forecasts daily restaurant foot traffic based on weather conditions and calendar context using machine learning. It features a prediction interface, historical trend analysis, and model interpretability.

## Project Overview

Restaurants often struggle to predict how many customers will visit on a given day. Weather, holidays, and weekends significantly impact traffic. Our project combines machine learning with historical data and weather features to help restaurant managers make better staffing and inventory decisions.

## How to Replicate Results

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CS506-FinalProject.git
cd CS506-FinalProject
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install required packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If needed:

```bash
pip install flask pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost holidays joblib
```

### 4. Add data

Include `simulated_foot_traffic_enhanced.csv` in the root directory with at least:

```csv
date,temperature,humidity,precipitation
2023-01-01,4.5,78,0.1
2023-01-02,2.0,60,0.0
...
```

### 5. Run the pipeline

```bash
python data_preprocessing.py
python exploratory_data_analysis.py
python modeling.py
```

### 6. Start the app

```bash
python app.py
```
